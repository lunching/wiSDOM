Example data sets and brief description of wiSDOM


1. Test_OTU_count.txt: Example of count data. The first column of input contains any user-specified column name and the unique taxa information followed by the data matrix (proportion) with sample IDs for column names.
2. Test_OTU_RA.txt: Example of relative abundance (RA) data (same format as 1).
3. Test_genus_RA.txt: Example of relative abundance (RA) data in genus level (same format as 1).
4. Test_index.txt: two groups index file example. The first column contains the sample IDs which need to match the sample IDs in count/RA input, and the second column of index file indicates any user-specified categorial variable, such as “case” and “control”.  
5. Test_index_4g.txt: multiple group index file example (same format as 4). 
6. OTU_ID_test.txt: Example of pseudo-OTU IDs for testing “Greengenes” database.
